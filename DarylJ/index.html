							<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
						</div>

						<div class="sectionContent">
							<p>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
							   I don’t my research on studying a Bachelor of Information Technology and decided to go through open university in which I was directed to RMIT through them as I have life commitments such as work and family, so I must complete my studies online and I never completed year 12 so my options where limited. I investigated the course frame through RMIT and was happy with it as it would give me the skills and knowledge required to find a career after completion and the have been rated a good university.</p>
                            <p>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?
                               I have read the course framework and I have the expectations of learning Programming basics to advance level. Web design, cloud computing, networking, storage and app creations. These are just some of the things that I will be learning. I will also learn to work with teams on projects and become better at communication via online applications like Microsoft teams. I will learn the ethical background and laws need in the industry I have chosen to pursue.</p>
                            <p>• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
                               Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
                               I am interested in robotics and A.I the most but really, I am interested in all technology and how it works and what I can learn and do to help others with the skills and knowledge I will gain during and after my studies.
                               I used the basic technology when growing up but didn’t really get interested in it until I was in the Army. This is where I started to get interested in it, I learn to communications and encryptions which was the starting point of my interest. From that point I started to teach my self through books and videos. Once I left the army I dropped out of interest for a little bit because of my PTSD. When I meet my wife, I started to feel a little bit normal again and started back on my quest to learn which became even better because my new father in-law was good with technology, he helped me learn to build computers.
                               I have worked with technology for a few years now from building computers to installing software. I have had to use excel, outlook, Microsoft word and teams with my role as Stock Controller.

							<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</h3>
							<p>The results given to me from these online tests tell me veery little about myself I don’t know. They are accurate in a lot of ways but then they ask questions and give answer with out know your mental disabilities if you have any, for example I suffer from PTSD and sometimes it affects me worst then others so answer to some of the questions would change. It a full view of these test it could be interesting for someone to see the results and know how to deal with me.</p>
					
							<h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
							<p>Theses results will have little impact on my behaviour with a team as I can focus on what needs the be done and do it by any means necessary. Certain things may have a slight impact, but I can manage and control my behaviour for the purpose of achieving a goal.</p>
					
							<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
							<p>In theory if I looked at my result and other students results for example I would try and match result together that would work best my team considering with learning styles, temperament and how well we would work together. </p>

					<div class="sectionContent">
						<article>
							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>Health care home automation A.I system which would be a package made up of multiple devices working together to maintain a constant monitoring system while person/persons are home. This will involve a system being setup in your home to watch and monitor movements and vital signs through an A.I system and cameras with sensors, a smart watch, and a phone application which would be free to all customers who purchase this package. This design would be for people with disabilities such as PTSD, epileptic, elderly and really anyone that suffers from something that could cause significant injury or even death that needs/wants to monitor their conditions in their home and when they are alone.</p>
						</article>

						<article>
							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>This would be very use project because this would help so many people and relieve a lot of stress from family members that would be worrying about loved ones. From my research there is an article from The World Health Organisation stating Northern Ireland (UK), United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Canada and Australia for people 60 years or older range from 1.6 to 3.0 per 10 000 population are being admitted to hospital for fall. Just to think about what I could do to prevent my grandparents from going through this has given me the idea and motivation to come up with this idea. The use of things like raspberry Pi technology would be used in the creation of this would save money and time and make it more affordable for me the designer and the customers.</p>
						</article>

						<article>
							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>This product will feature 24/7 home monitoring when you are home, this will be possible with the smart watch features and phone application that will let the system know when you have entered or exited your home. This system will be made using multiple Raspberry Pi systems setup up around your home. A.I system installed to monitor and track movements and vitals and monitor body temperature through the inferred sensors, cameras and the sensors build into your smart watch. 
                               The A.I system will be designed to do a scan of you when it is first setup to help keep track of the right person. This program will be designed to interact with its user, if decided to activate this feature you could ask for weather report, call family/friends via connection to your phone through the application provided. During the setup you will be prompted to fill out an emergency contact section which will include email and contact number as this will be used for one of the features of safety alerts to emergency contact if anything happens example you fall and hurt yourself and you need assistance but cannot get to the phone or the system picks up on you having a epileptic fit in which it will sent out an SOS to your emergency contact and contact emergency services. With this A.I design it will be able to learn movement patterns like the way you walk, so if you hurt your leg, it would be able to re-adjust your movement pattern to assess if you have injured for self and how severe it maybe. 
                               The application for your phone will be free to download, this will feature monitoring system where you can share details like vitals and camera footage to your emergency contact so they can keep an eye on your and know everything is ok. You can store data of your vitals to show and share with medical professionals any time you want. This will include 24/7 technical services and constant bug fixes to make sure it runs without any problems. The application is yours and no one can see any information as we will provide an encryption to stop anyone from to the access it. The Raspberry Pi system will feature cameras and sensors to which you choose where you want the cameras setup and the sensors, this will come in different size packs to suit different sized homes so if you want a camera in every room but still want your privacy in certain rooms then you can set that camera up to sensors only, that way it can still pick up if you have a fall for example. The watch you will be able to use any smart watch that can access the application to link up and relay data it collects like rise in heart rate or your sleep cycle, this in turn will help the A.I learn and monitor more accurately to these results and patterns relayed to the system. 
                            </p>

							<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
							<p>The infrared Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 NoIR- this can be added to the Raspberry Pi as a camera with inferred for uses at night-time.
                               Raspberry Pi is the main component for the system, as it’s the computer that will store the A.I on it and operate the system. 
                               The MQ gas sensors can detect different gases at room temperature, this will be a handle addition to the package for the elderly who for get to turn the stove off.
                               The PIR motion sensor - a signal is sent only if something moves. It can be uses to activate the lighting or to turn on touch screen for home automation as soon as you get close to it.
                               2.4 GHz NRF24L01+ Modul is a wireless communication addon that uses 2.4 GHz frequency, this means it can transfer larger amount of data. A second Raspberry Pi can also be equipped with a 2.4 GHz receiver / transmitter and get commands from a “base station” and send back data.
                               TensorFlow is an open source artificial intelligence software. that helps you develop and train Machine learning models, this free AI software. This software you can develop voice/sound recognition, text-based applications, image recognition, video detection.
                            </p>
						</article>

						<article>
							<h3>Skills Required</h3>
							<p>I will need advance programming skills to write the A.I program and phone application as this will have to be constantly checked and fixed. For the A.I program I will use TensorFlow and will have to have a good understanding of Artificial Intelligence and how it works to develop it to suit the project and programming skill and knowledge of multiple languages. I will need to write an application for IOS and android with advanced programming skills.
                               For this skillset to start the project soon, I would have to hire out for these roles, but in distant future once I complete my Bachelor, I will have the skill set to create all this.  
                            </p>
						</article>

						<article>
							<h3>Outcome</h3>
							<p>If the project become successful it would start to get result on the for the groups it is aimed for, which could be good or bad for some as it will no doubt have its bugs and glitches like all products but that’s what the project team will be there to rectify these as fast as possible. This could have a significant impact on how people live with the feature like vitals monitoring, so you will know if something isn’t right before it gets worse. </p>
