        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

    <p>
        <b> Q1 - What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? <br>
        Q2 - Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any) <br>
        Q3 - Why did you choose to come to RMIT? <br>
        Q4 - What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>A1</b> - Originally, I had 0 interest in IT, or technology in general. I just used some apps and played some games. However, when figuring out my future, 
        I had decided that what I would end up living had to be good for my future without boring me to death (...maybe even after death) and to do that
        I had to make a decicion. To make a short story even shorter: I entered the certificate III of Information, Digital Media, and Technology 
        and my curiosity/interest started there.</p>
    
    <p><b>A2</b> - There was no particular event or person for it, I just realised I enjoyed programming the more I did it. As for my experience,
        It all started near the end of summer, 2021. I had just finished year 10 and decided that a job that was less focused on physical labour was ideal for me.
        So I entered Tafe with the sole purpose of figuring out which section I wanted to learn more about. That section was revealed to be programming.
        So after 6 months the Certificate IV had become my targeted goal. After learning about and enjoy the langauge of C# and (not-so) langauge
        of HTML, I decided to learn more.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>A3</b> - When the decision to learn more had arisen I had two paths. The first of the two was the Diploma of Software Development while the second was the Bachelor of IT.
        Each decision had it's pros, each decision  had it's cons. <br>
        If I were to choose the Diploma I could finish it in 6 months BUT my knowledge of technology would be limited to what was learned in those 6 months (excluding individual work, but that oly gets someone so far) <br>
        If I were to choose the Bachelor it would take six times the length HOWEVER would teach so much more, and aside from the coding i'm unsure about what else i'd enjoy.<br>
        RMIT provides the courses to learn more about technology and I'm curious enough to follow through and learn more.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>A4</b> - During my time here there are plenty of things I hope to learn and/or master, those sections of IT include - <br>
        | Programming - python, java, c++, html. All computer languages are awesome and I can't wait to learn more. <br>
        | Cloud - The storage of tommorow, today. <br>
        | A.I. - In all of human history, creating an artificial, human-like being may just be when we peak. Alternatively, it could be the beginning we could never imagine. <br>
        | UIs - Conveniant and overall useful. Who doesn't judge an app by it's UI? <br>
