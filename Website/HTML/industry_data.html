            <h2>Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                A software developer/programmer develops code for just about anything, from a simple calculator to 
                a full-blown business organisation/management system. Code can be and is used for video games, 
                business management, website interactions, social media, mathematics, robots, and so much more. 
                Because of this, I want to be a developer so that I can learn to create fun, helpful, medical, or 
                robotic programs. 
                <br><br>
                An important question to consider, however, is the difference between a developer and an engineer. 
                Their jobs are very similar, and the coding languages they use are the same. A developer creates, 
                modifies, and debugs their code as well as makes them specific for their customer. An engineer has 
                most of those same roles with the additions of analytics, scaling, testing, and a lot more 
                communication. This makes an engineer’s work, ever so slightly, a more complex job than that of a 
                developer. 
                <br><br>
                Using the 2018 Burning Glass data, in IT job titles, “developer” is split into the coding/computer 
                languages used (e.g., Python developer), as well as front-end and back-end developers (e.g., CSS 
                (front), HTML (back)). The developer-based rankings are as follows - <br>
                > Net Developer | 3rd <br>
                > Front End Developer | 6th <br>
                > Java Developer | 7th <br>
                > Senior Net Developer | 12th <br>
                > Senior Java Developer | 13th <br>
                > Web Developer | 15th <br>
                > Full Stack Developer | 17th <br><br>
                The software developer skills, using the Burning Glass data, are about the coding/computer languages 
                used. The rankings are as follows - <br>
                > SQL | 1st <br>
                > JavaScript | 2nd <br>
                > Java | 3rd <br>
                > SAP | 6th <br>
                > Microsoft C# | 12th <br>
                > NET Programming | 16th <br>
                > Oracle | 19th <br>
                > Git | 21st <br>
                > Python | 22nd <br><br>
                The generic skillset is mainly about the type of things anyone can learn to do (e.g., communication). 
                The top rankings that apply to software development include - <br>
                > Communication | 1st (Landslide) <br>
                > Problem Solving | 2nd <br>
                > Organisation | 3rd <br>
                > Writing | 4th <br>
                > Collaboration | 5th <br> 
                > Planning | 7th <br> 
                > Detail Oriented | 8th <br> 
                > Creativity | 9th <br> 
                > Time Management | 12th <br><br> 
                Each of these skills are very important and if used correctly, can shape a developer’s career from 
                an average developer to a well-known pro. The importance of these skills for a developer are 
                dependent on whether they work by themself or within a team, however, each skill is important in 
                some form or another. <br><br>
                Communication - <br>
                Communication skills are important because they allow developers to understand what a customer 
                would want to be created, or it would help them work well within a team, or properly discuss issues 
                within a system, the code, or just about anything else. Developers aren’t the only field to require 
                communication, and it doesn’t stop at the IT industry either. Just about every job is reliant on 
                some form of Commnication, whether it’s discussing work related issues, making well written emails, 
                or even just talking to people. 
                <br><br>
                Problem Solving - <br>
                Problem-solving is an important skill to develop, preferably early on, because not one good program 
                is ever written without at least some errors. Being able to identify and solve code-related issues 
                would show off the true skills of a developer. 
                <br><br>
                Organisation - <br>
                Organisation code and directories are great skills, and ones that I like, coincidentally those 2 
                skills are required for any good developer. This is because other developers within a team, or a 
                tester just looking through will need to understand what your code says to properly, and effectively 
                continue their work. 
                <br><br>
                Writing - <br>
                When coding, the developer writes using two things, the first is a computer-understood syntax 
                (e.g., Python) and the second is utilising a human-understood syntax (e.g., English). This means 
                that being able to effectively write can be the difference between a good program and an amazing 
                one, no matter what it’s for. 
                <br><br>
                Collaboration - <br>
                A small program can be developed by one person, and with enough time, so can a medium-sized project 
                however, one person cannot work on and create a large/gigantic project full of code, designs, 
                databases, music, or even artificial intelligence. A team is required to really bring a gigantic 
                project to life, and unless the developer is unable to collaborate with others, it would just be a 
                waste of time having them on board. 
                <br><br>
                Planning - <br>
                Planning is an important skill because no program is exactly the same, effectively planning which 
                language, modules, and even way in which the code will be written, will make whatever program a 
                developer creates far better. 
                <br><br>
                Detail Oriented - <br>
                Being detail oriented is yet another skill that could be classified as important, even necessary. 
                A developer being detail oriented would have their program properly indented, filled with enough 
                error exceptions to keep the code working without adding too much/little, and code containing all 
                the necessary detail that is required of it without messing up the program. Orientation to detail 
                is an important skill, and one that is required to help the program work to its highest standard.
                <br><br>  
                Creativity - <br>
                Creativity can go hand in hand with planning, a developer will need to plan how they will build the 
                program, but just how good of a program it will be is dependent on how they decide to write the 
                code, the positions of the try/catch they use, and where they decide to put everything. Besides 
                layout, sometimes a creative solution would be the answer to a bug, or an annoying issue.  
                <br><br>
                Time Management - <br>
                When making a program, there is usually a deadline that the customer would want it by and being 
                able to split their work up to fit that deadline is a very necessary skill to ensure that the 
                customer ends up satisfied. 
                <br><br>
                As for the technical and general skills that a developer does not have, these are the top 3 for 
                each, respectively - <br>
                > Project Management | 5th <br>
                > Business Management | 7th   <br>
                > Business Analysis | 9th  <br>
                > Troubleshooting | 6th  <br>
                > Research | 10th <br>
                > Leadership | 11th <br>
                Having each of these skills would be beneficial for a developer, there is no denying that, however, 
                they are not required. <br><br>
                Project Management - <br>
                This skill would be amazing for a project manager, in fact, it’s required, but a developer, 
                unless special circumstances intervened, would not be managing the project that they work on 
                in a team. So, while it would be a great way to take a break from coding and do something else 
                with their life, it isn’t an essential skill for a developer. 
                <br><br>  
                Business Management - <br>
                Managing a business and managing a project are two separate things, their only thing in common 
                is that someone is managing something however, the reasons a developer would not manage a 
                project is very similar to the reasons they would not manage a business. While it is very 
                unlikely, one reason they might is if the business was a software company, and the manager had 
                the time to do more than their managerial duties. This isn’t to say that a developer cannot 
                become a manager, but their path of work would have to take quite a turn for it to become both 
                a reality and effective. 
                <br><br>  
                Business Analysis - <br>
                “Business analysis is a professional discipline of identifying business needs and determining 
                solutions to business problems.” This skill, while very helpful to a business manager, does, 
                if not nothing then very little to a developer. This is because a developer’s work is done by 
                writing the program a company will use, and that program’s specifications would be provided by 
                the company. The skill has nothing to do with the job. 
                <br><br>  
                Troubleshooting - <br>
                Troubleshooting is defined as ‘analysing and solving serious problems for a company or other 
                organisation”. The most of analysing and solving problems that a developer would be doing is 
                debugging a program, and that is nowhere near the scale of analysis and reparation that a 
                trouble shooter would be doing. This difference is why troubleshooting is not essential for a 
                developer. 
                <br><br>  
                Research - <br>
                When a developer is hired, they are expected to know the language, its modules, and how to best 
                use it without having to google it. This reason is why research is a skill that a developer does 
                not need, in fact it’s one that they shouldn’t use entirely, at the very least, during work. 
                <br><br>  
                Leadership - <br>
                The job of a developer is primarily to write the code of a program that the company or 
                individual(s) hired them to create, sometimes it would include being able to code through the 
                frontend instead of just the backend of the program in creation. There is nothing in this job 
                that points towards being a leader, and as such leadership is a skill sold separately. 
                <br><br>  
                Unlike an engineer, a developer’s jobs are split into the languages that they use, and this 
                makes finding an exact placement very hard, however as the first list mentioned above a net 
                developer is placed in third, a frontend developer is placed in sixth, and a java developer is 
                placed in seventh. These three are not the only factions of software development, but net, 
                frontend, and java are clearly the most in-demand, at least when looking through Burning Glass’ 
                top IT occupations of 2018. 
                <br><br>  
                According to the “Skills Priority List” (official government document) it is very clearly that 
                software development is a job with a very strong continuation into the future and being a 
                strongly continued job means that its very necessary. The usual job experience required of a 
                developer is, at a minimum, 2 to 3 years for an excellent, well-paying job however, while 
                unlikely, there are some companies willing to hire those with less than the usual amount of 
                experience. 
                <br><br>  
                Personally, after taking in all this information, I see no reason to change my desired field, 
                I still want the kind of job where I can create some amazing things to help people, and myself. 
                Like all paths, there are hardships to overcome, and software development’s set include the 
                frustration of code issues/bugs, small, or extremely small deadlines, vague program requirements, 
                possible team issues, and last-minute issues. There is no doubt I have where any of these 
                issues are strong enough to make me quit the field, besides, the modern world runs on code, 
                and this means that my preferred field is extremely unlikely to end in redundancy.
