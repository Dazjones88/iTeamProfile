            <h2>Adam Profile</h2>
            <!-- Copy and paste your profile info from the A2 document into the <p> section right below -->
            <p>
                My name is Adam Saleh, my student number is S3940024. My hobbies include playing video games 
                (Assassin’s Creed, Skyrim, Dragon Ball XenoVerse, Halo, Sonic), watching movies (Expendables, 
                Terminator, Rocky, The Mummy, Spiderman), tv shows (The Flash, Big Bang Theory, Futurama, 
                Simpsons, One Piece), and abridged series (SAO Abridged, DBZ Abridged, Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged). 
                I’ve done pixel art for a few months and started trying out blender (I made a list of hotkeys) 
                because I'm interested in design as a hobby. The IT jobs I'm most interested in are software 
                development and game development. 
                <br><br>
                My interest In IT is mainly in programming, machine learning, robots, and the potential of 
                artificial intelligence, however my skills and experience are very little. I started IT last 
                year with the Cert III in IT with Tafe. After the Cert III, came the Cert IV in Programming 
                which taught someone who couldn’t even display “hello world” C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JS . I 
                taught myself a little bit of Python (Py game) and Java (J Frame) before starting this course. 
                <br><br>
                My Myers-Briggs personality is the ISTP-T Turbulent Virtuoso, this personality type is 
                described as rationalized, curious, and creators, they prefer pulling things apart to put 
                them back together, usually better than it was before. They are known as friendly, private, 
                curious, overhasty and practically realistic. An ISTP’s strengths include being optimistic, 
                energetic, creative, practical, spontaneous, rational, prioritisation, composed, and excellent 
                at handling a crisis. Their weaknesses include being stubborn, insensitive, private, easily 
                bored, disliking commitment, and risky behaviour. 
                <br><br>
                The learning style best suited to me is the pragmatist style, a style that learns best from 
                practical, case studies, problem setting, and discussions. A pragmatist is keen to try out 
                ideas/theories to see if they work, search new ideas, and take the first opportunity to test 
                an application. My secondary learning style, of the same score (0.250), is the reflector style, 
                this style learns best with paired discussions, self-analysis questionnaires, demonstrations, 
                feedback, and coaching. The reflector style of learning is more about observing, data gathering
                and analysing than it is the practical approach.  
                <br><br>
                The two workstyle tests I’ve done have indicated that I am an “integrator” and an organised 
                planner. An integrator’s preferred roles are problem-solving and diagnostics with a strong 
                preference for understanding the why of what’s being done. They are known to be self-reliant 
                and prefer the “plan-first” approach. The second of the tests that I’ve done indicates that my 
                preferred way of work is to organize and plan my work, which, as proven by working with this 
                team, is where my strengths lie.  
                <br><br>
                For iTeam, a name I support, I should be able to help organize the work that needs to be done, 
                come up with creative solutions or ideas, prioritise my duties based on time and importance, 
                try out software that is new to me without hesitation, create creative code for the project, 
                and, if need be, I will discuss our course of actions if I do not agree with them. This doesn’t 
                mean I don’t have my weaknesses though, everyone does. As I’ve learnt from the tests I’ve done, 
                and personal experience, my weaknesses within iTeam might just include leaving important but 
                boring tasks until the end, an approach to explanations that lack a practical containing less 
                than ideal memorisations, and getting my tasks done early on and expecting most, if not all, 
                to take a similar approach.

            <h2>Software Developer</h2>
            <!-- Give your ideal job a one paragraph description and one paragraph on why you like the job -->
            <p>
                The role of a software developer entails developing, testing, (and sometimes designing) a 
                program using one of very, very many computer & human understood languages, the role itself
                is split into the languages used, for example there is a .Net developer, they create 
                applications using Microsoft's .Net languages such as C# and VB, a Java developer can create
                applications, games, mobile apps using the language Java, a Python developer can create many
                applications, like java, and uses the language Python. There are many more out there, like SQL,
                a database management language, JavaScript, a scripting language that can make any website 
                interactive, and, while no one counts them as "programming languages", HTML and CSS are used
                to develop websites. Programs are even being made to work with robots, A.I., and self driving 
                cars.
                <br><br>
                I'm interested in two different work pathways, software development and game development, but
                my focus is on the development of software because I love the idea of being able to create
                just about anything fun, useful, medical, robotic, helpful, ect. from scratch without limiting
                myself to just gaming, all while at the comfort of my favorite chair. Like I mentioned above, 
                software development is split into the languages used for it, like C#, Java, and Python and at 
                this point in time I have had experience using all three of them, I've used C# during my Cert 
                IV of Programming to create a sample management system, I've taught myself some Java and it's 
                JFrame module, with it I've created a couple tutorials for myself to go back to if I ever need 
                to, and with Python I've used the pygame module to make a small game, the game in question needs 
                a little refining, but the point of creating it was to try out the pygame module. While using 
                all 3 of these languages I've encountered many, many code issues from syntax to run-time which 
                have helped me develop the skills I currently have, and with more erors along the way I have
                more chances to learn and refine the way I code. I can confindently say that using all 3 have 
                increased my interest in the subject and have reassured me that this is the right path.

            <h2>Digital Card Game</h2>
            <!-- Summarise your A1 project idea, possibly around 3 paragraphs -->
            <p>
                The idea I presented my group was Oblituma, a fantasy story played through a digital card game.
                <br><br>
                The story of the game is essentially about a planet that is going to destroy itself, and how
                it's inhabitants attempt to save themselves. There are many methods in doing so which causes 
                factions to be formed, those factions are the Knights, Rune-Weilders, Gear-Borns, Elementals, 
                Demi-Humans, and the Undead. Each faction has a method that they believe will either save their 
                world or just themselves, and each faction is willing to put their lives on the line in order 
                to try.
                <br><br>
                The game's Story Mode would progress through the collection of notes/letters that each faction 
                leader would have left in order to make their side known. Each faction's story would contain 
                ~10 notes to play through and unlock items in. Other modes of the game include Battle Mode 
                which sees the player going up against another, Bot Mode which would let the player go up 
                against a bot with any deck the player chooses to go against, and Side-Story Mode which would
                function very similarly to Story Mode with the difference being that each side story is made 
                to allow the player to understand the lore of the world.
                <br><br>
                The skills and experience that would be required for the game are - <br>
                > Unity Game Engine <br>
                > C# Programming Language <br>
                > SQL Skills <br>
                > Knowledge of the Cloud <br>
                > Artisic Talent, preferably digital <br>
                > Musical Talent, of any instrument <br>
                My plan is that the game would runs on the Windows operating system, using the programming 
                language C#, and utilises an SQL database to hold all the details of the cards. The game would
                obtain the details of these cards, such as name, artwork, etc. through a cloud server. 
                I want to create the game using the Unity Game Engine because it is a free engine that
                anyone can learn to use and is able to create 2d games. The game should be easily downloadable
                from Steam and connect to the database to be through the cloud.
                <br><br>
                For A3/5 the demo of the game would have been to create 2 structure decks, that would be ~60 
                cards total, and create Bot Mode and an opening tutorial so that the player can learn to play
                the game and try it out too.
