            <h2>Adam Profile</h2>
            <!-- Copy and paste your profile info from the A2 document into the <p> section right below -->
            <p>
                My name is Adam Saleh, my student number is S3940024. My hobbies include playing video games 
                (Assassin’s Creed, Skyrim, Dragon Ball XenoVerse, Halo, Sonic), watching movies (Expendables, 
                Terminator, Rocky, The Mummy, Spiderman), tv shows (The Flash, Big Bang Theory, Futurama, 
                Simpsons, One Piece), and abridged series (SAO Abridged, DBZ Abridged, Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged). 
                I’ve done pixel art for a few months and started trying out blender (I made a list of hotkeys) 
                because I'm interested in design as a hobby. The IT jobs I'm most interested in are software 
                development and game development. 
                <br><br>
                My interest In IT is mainly in programming, machine learning, robots, and the potential of 
                artificial intelligence, however my skills and experience are very little. I started IT last 
                year with the Cert III in IT with Tafe. After the Cert III, came the Cert IV in Programming 
                which taught someone who couldn’t even display “hello world” C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JS . I 
                taught myself a little bit of Python (Py game) and Java (J Frame) before starting this course. 
                <br><br>
                My Myers-Briggs personality is the ISTP-T Turbulent Virtuoso, this personality type is 
                described as rationalized, curious, and creators, they prefer pulling things apart to put 
                them back together, usually better than it was before. They are known as friendly, private, 
                curious, overhasty and practically realistic. An ISTP’s strengths include being optimistic, 
                energetic, creative, practical, spontaneous, rational, prioritisation, composed, and excellent 
                at handling a crisis. Their weaknesses include being stubborn, insensitive, private, easily 
                bored, disliking commitment, and risky behaviour. 
                <br><br>
                The learning style best suited to me is the pragmatist style, a style that learns best from 
                practical, case studies, problem setting, and discussions. A pragmatist is keen to try out 
                ideas/theories to see if they work, search new ideas, and take the first opportunity to test 
                an application. My secondary learning style, of the same score (0.250), is the reflector style, 
                this style learns best with paired discussions, self-analysis questionnaires, demonstrations, 
                feedback, and coaching. The reflector style of learning is more about observing, data gathering
                and analysing than it is the practical approach.  
                <br><br>
                The two workstyle tests I’ve done have indicated that I am an “integrator” and an organised 
                planner. An integrator’s preferred roles are problem-solving and diagnostics with a strong 
                preference for understanding the why of what’s being done. They are known to be self-reliant 
                and prefer the “plan-first” approach. The second of the tests that I’ve done indicates that my 
                preferred way of work is to organize and plan my work, which, as proven by working with this 
                team, is where my strengths lie.  
                <br><br>
                For iTeam, a name I support, I should be able to help organize the work that needs to be done, 
                come up with creative solutions or ideas, prioritise my duties based on time and importance, 
                try out software that is new to me without hesitation, create creative code for the project, 
                and, if need be, I will discuss our course of actions if I do not agree with them. This doesn’t 
                mean I don’t have my weaknesses though, everyone does. As I’ve learnt from the tests I’ve done, 
                and personal experience, my weaknesses within iTeam might just include leaving important but 
                boring tasks until the end, an approach to explanations that lack a practical containing less 
                than ideal memorisations, and getting my tasks done early on and expecting most, if not all, 
                to take a similar approach.

            <h2>Software Developer</h2>
            <!-- Give your ideal job a one paragraph description and one paragraph on why you like the job -->
            <p>
                The role of a software developer entails developing, testing, (and sometimes designing) a 
                program using one of very, very many computer & human understood languages, the role itself
                is split into the languages used, for example there is a .Net developer, they create 
                applications using Microsoft's .Net languages such as C# and VB, a Java developer can create
                applications, games, mobile apps using the language Java, a Python developer can create many
                applications, like java, and uses the language Python. There are many more out there, like SQL,
                a database management language, JavaScript, a scripting language that can make any website 
                interactive, and, while no one counts them as "programming languages", HTML and CSS are used
                to develop websites. Programs are even being made to work with robots, A.I., and self driving 
                cars.
                <br><br>
                I'm interested in two different work pathways, software development and game development, but
                my focus is on the development of software because I love the idea of being able to create
                just about anything fun, useful, medical, robotic, helpful, ect. from scratch without limiting
                myself to just gaming, all while at the comfort of my favorite chair. Like I mentioned above, 
                software development is split into the languages used for it, like C#, Java, and Python and at 
                this point in time I have had experience using all three of them, I've used C# during my Cert 
                IV of Programming to create a sample management system, I've taught myself some Java and it's 
                JFrame module, with it I've created a couple tutorials for myself to go back to if I ever need 
                to, and with Python I've used the pygame module to make a small game, the game in question needs 
                a little refining, but the point of creating it was to try out the pygame module. While using 
                all 3 of these languages I've encountered many, many code issues from syntax to run-time which 
                have helped me develop the skills I currently have, and with more erors along the way I have
                more chances to learn and refine the way I code. I can confindently say that using all 3 have 
                increased my interest in the subject and have reassured me that this is the right path.

            <h2>Digital Card Game</h2>
            <!-- Summarise your A1 project idea, possibly around 3 paragraphs -->
            <p>
                The idea I presented my group was Oblituma, a fantasy story played through a digital card game.
                <br><br>
                The story of the game is essentially about a planet that is going to destroy itself, and how
                it's inhabitants attempt to save themselves. There are many methods in doing so which causes 
                factions to be formed, those factions are the Knights, Rune-Weilders, Gear-Borns, Elementals, 
                Demi-Humans, and the Undead. Each faction has a method that they believe will either save their 
                world or just themselves, and each faction is willing to put their lives on the line in order 
                to try.
                <br><br>
                The game's Story Mode would progress through the collection of notes/letters that each faction 
                leader would have left in order to make their side known. Each faction's story would contain 
                ~10 notes to play through and unlock items in. Other modes of the game include Battle Mode 
                which sees the player going up against another, Bot Mode which would let the player go up 
                against a bot with any deck the player chooses to go against, and Side-Story Mode which would
                function very similarly to Story Mode with the difference being that each side story is made 
                to allow the player to understand the lore of the world.
                <br><br>
                The skills and experience that would be required for the game are - <br>
                > Unity Game Engine <br>
                > C# Programming Language <br>
                > SQL Skills <br>
                > Knowledge of the Cloud <br>
                > Artisic Talent, preferably digital <br>
                > Musical Talent, of any instrument <br>
                My plan is that the game would runs on the Windows operating system, using the programming 
                language C#, and utilises an SQL database to hold all the details of the cards. The game would
                obtain the details of these cards, such as name, artwork, etc. through a cloud server. 
                I want to create the game using the Unity Game Engine because it is a free engine that
                anyone can learn to use and is able to create 2d games. The game should be easily downloadable
                from Steam and connect to the database to be through the cloud.
                <br><br>
                For A3/5 the demo of the game would have been to create 2 structure decks, that would be ~60 
                cards total, and create Bot Mode and an opening tutorial so that the player can learn to play
                the game and try it out too.

             <h2>James Profile</h2>

        <p>
            My name is James (s3936965), and I have worked as an IT technician for 
            several years before moving into operations. At present, my hobbies include 
            3D printing and CNC machining. Something I have always enjoyed is gaming mostly 
            on console and mobile. I have a good fundamental understanding of IT hardware, 
            but I have always felt my software understanding could be better. I would love to 
            develop skills that would allow me to produce mobile apps, but I have recently taken 
            an interest in machine learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence). 
            <br><br>
            As a member of iTeam, I am looking forward to sharing my skills and expertise and 
            learning some new ones from fellow team members.  
            <br><br>
            My test outcome for the Myers Brigs personality type was Architect INTJ-A. The architect's 
            personality type is outlined as a quiet individual who values organisation and rationality, 
            these values I align with. Individuals with this personality type can be viewed as ambitious 
            and assertive; however, to work within a small team, I believe it is beneficial to be flexible 
            and play to the entire team's strengths rather than one individual. 
            <br><br>
            My Learning style test outcomes, Auditory: 15% Visual: 55% Tactile: 30%. This test aligns with 
            what I know about myself and how I learn. While my auditory percentile might indicate I am not a 
            good listener, I believe this is more specific to how I can take in new information. I am much 
            better when I can be shown something rather than told. The refinement of these skills comes from 
            hands-on experience of the tactile branch of the above outcomes. 
            <br><br>
            My creativity test score was 68.8, a remarkably arbitrary number assigned at the end of a creativity test. 
            However, within that number were indicated certain aspects of creativity that I was more proficient at, such 
            as complexity or the ability to take in and manipulate large amounts of data. Paradox, the ability to accept 
            and work with contradictory statements and curiosity, is the desire to change or improve things that everyone 
            takes for granted.

            <h2>Machine Learning Engineer</h2>
            <!-- Give your ideal job a one paragraph description and one paragraph on why you like the job -->
            <p>
            Machine learning is a field that I find interesting, dealing with large data sets and teaching machines 
            how to think and interpret data in oversimplified terms. I find this fascinating because, in my head, it is about 
            providing context to data and teaching computers how to provide this context. I love puzzles and enjoy seeing 
            patterns that align with interpreting large data sets and giving context to the data. This is also something that 
            aligns with the role of a data scientist. However, the machine learning engineer is more focused on the code aspect 
            of the interpretation. The data scientist will deal primarily with the data, and the machine learning engineer will 
            write the code that interprets the data.
            <br><br>
            The primary duties of the above role focus mainly on coding, deploying and moderating Machine Learning code. This 
            involves communicating with the data scientists and documenting ideas and processes involved in the code creation. 
            They reference the Agile framework in the job ad, which refers to a framework for managing, planning and executing 
            work.
            <br><br>
            They require experience in Microsoft Azure, a cloud computing service, and multiple apps associated with the service, 
            including Azure Databricks, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Kubernetes. Most of these services revolve around large 
            data sets and provide computing power to analyse large data sets that would be beyond the abilities of your primary 
            workstation.
            <br>
            They also focus on proven ability to work with data scientists, architects and platform engineers. Most of the work 
            and communication with these other professionals revolves around MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) and ML code. 
            <br>
            Finally, practical experience in Python, a coding language, and Apache Spark, an application for managing large sets.
            <br><br>
            Most of the above are far beyond my current skillset; I have no experience in Machine learning. I have used Microsoft 
            online cloud computing tools such as Microsoft BI (Business insights), similar to Azure but with very different 
            implementation. I also have essential experience coding some C++ and Python, but I would need a better grasp to 
            communicate with the other mentioned professionals. 
            <br><br>
            The Best way for me to obtain the nessasery skills to apply for a job like the one that is mentioned is to continue 
            my studies; achieving different experience around the field and preliminary use of the products mentioned in the app 
            will provide me with a great foundation to begin to pursue a job like this. I will also need practical experience 
            working with professionals mentioned in the ad, which will come from finding work experience within the same field, 
            potentially as an intern, or working in a lower set role, before applying to a job like the one mentioned.

            <p>
                <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <br>
        We all live in communities both online and physically, and between all members, there exists an 
        overwhelming amount of tools and skills, most of which are rarely tapped into. Today's world, 
        thanks to information technologies, is amazingly broad. We are all-access a world of skills and 
        people that would have seemed far out of reach not so many years ago. Neighbourhood Supply is 
        about communities pooling resources from a drill, mower, 3d printer or any other tool or skill 
        that could be used in your local area. People can list items or abilities available to borrow 
        or rent to their communities. 
        <br><br>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        Have you ever found yourself in a position at home where you need, say, a drill? Buying one seems 
        a little unnecessary this is the first time you've needed one and probably won't need one again 
        for a while, so you open the Neighbourhood Supply app, as it turns out your neighbour two doors 
        down as a drill you can borrow for $5 a day. To rent the drill, you need to be a member will a 
        credit card or debit card attached to the app; you are told that the replacement fee for the 
        drill is $99, which is held until the drill is returned. You are charged $104 and refunded 99 
        dollars when the drill has been returned in good condition. 
        <br>
        This same model could also apply to skills and general labour tasks, think of washing as an example; 
        you might have a broken washing machine or dryer, perhaps you need someone to iron your shirts. 
        While you could take them to the laundry mat, you jump onto the app and find out Terry will do 
        a bag wash for $5. He lives two streets away, which seems a bit far for you; after all, you don't 
        want to drive there or walk a bag to his house, but then you notice he will pick up the bag and deliver 
        it for another $5. 
        <br><br>
        The idea here is that it connects people and provides community value. While most other similar services 
        and apps focus on social as a driver, this will primarily revolve around commodities found within our 
        communities. This type of local venture is becoming more and more critical as the world continues to 
        change. Issues such as inflation are driving the price of most goods up due to how our economy is structured, 
        but by using the power of information technology, we could help find some of those small-town values our world 
        was built on.
        <br>
        Keep in mind that while this app will not be targeted at professionals, it will not stop professionals that live 
        in your local radius from promoting their services potentially at a discounted rate after all you are neighbours, 
        but primarily focus on the ordinary people skills set or no training required. The app, in its essence, is not designed 
        to compete with Facebook or Neighbourhood, two apps that promote social connection as a foundation both on a local scale and 
        offer similar services as an add on but offer the services as a primary feature and social link a secondary benefit to 
        the user. The most crucial part of structuring the app will be defining a radius for local connection for most services 
        and rentals. A maximum of 3km should be applied, but for some speciality services or rentals, up to 5km could be suggested, 
        especially if the user is prepared to travel. Allowing the user to apply a radius of their own is also an option.
