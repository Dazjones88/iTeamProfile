            <h2>Robots -</h2>
            <!-- Copy & paste your technology details from the A2 document here -->
            <h3>What Does It Do?</h3>
            <p>
                The Oxford dictionary gives two definitions to robots -
                <br>
                1 - A machine that is made to look like a human and that can do some things that a human 
                can do
                <br>
                2 - A machine that can perform a complicated series of tasks automatically 
                <br><br>
                In the past neither of those were possibilities, but that didn’t stop Hollywood from making 
                the Terminator. Today the field of robotics is in almost every aspect of our lives, and it’s 
                evolving at a rapid pace. In fact, a robot has been created that looks somewhat like a human, 
                this robot, Ameca, is in the process of learning human-like facial expressions. Each of Ameca’s 
                modules/parts run independently, so just the head, or arm would work without any major issues. 
                At this point in time, Ameca can detect people, track their faces, detect objects and react to 
                them. Ameca can even move in a human-like manner. 
                <br><br>
                Other than Ameca, some robots are being used or developed to do jobs that could be considered 
                dirty, boring, or dangerous. Those kinds of jobs include - <br>
                > Manufacturing <br>
                > Assembly <br>
                > Packing <br>
                > Transport <br>
                > Earth / Space Exploration <br> 
                > Surgery <br>
                > Weaponry <br>
                > Lab Research <br>
                > Burger Creation <br>
                Yes, a robot was made to create burgers. Some are even being used as emotional support for 
                the lonely.
                <br><br>
                A few robotic projects of the past include - 
                <br><br>
                2011 Burger Bot - <br>
                A robot that can create a burger in less than 10 seconds, developed by Momentum Machines. 
                It can "slice toppings like tomatoes and pickles immediately before it places the slice 
                onto your burger, giving you the freshest burger possible." It was created as a garage project 
                and gained years of excitement. 
                <br><br>
                Google’s worker robots - <br>
                Google won a patent on March 31st, 2015, to create worker robots with personalities. The 
                personalities are downloadable from the cloud. One robot can download and use many personalities 
                so that it can interact with many different types of people. 
                <br><br>
                UR3 Arm - <br>
                On March 23rd, 2015, Universal Robots, a Denmark-based robotics company revealed the UR3, a 
                robot designed to handle repetitive manual tasks that weigh up to 3kg. It can replace its own 
                parts and can glue, paint, solder, and weld. 
                <br><br>
                Saul Robot - <br>
                In 2014, Xenex created a robot capable of handling the deadly disease Ebola. It does so with 
                powerful pulses of highly electrical ultraviolet rays, these rays weaken the cells of the Ebola 
                virus. This bot was named Saul Robot. 
                <br><br>
                Asus Zenbo - <br>
                This robot was created on March 21st, 2016, and is essentially your tiny, friendly home 
                assistant. It can autonomously roll around, as well as understand your verbal commands to 
                enable it to do tasks. An Asus Zenbo can be used to remember daily tasks, monitor surroundings 
                to detect emergencies, and it can access smart home services. 
                <br><br>
                Some robotic parts currently in the development segment of creation includes the artificial 
                muscles, artificial skin, and the elastic electric cable. 
                <br><br>
                Artificial Muscles - <br>
                The artificial muscles are created with Carbon Nanotubes. These nanotubes are created with 
                double electrode layers that are separated by a chitosan electrolyte layer consisting of an 
                ionic liquid. The response time is 19 milliseconds, thousands of available frequency ranges, 
                large stress generation of a rate of 1080 Megapascals per second, and high mechanical output 
                power density of 244 Watts per kilogram. This means that the artificial muscles have low power 
                consumption, high flexibility, and a very long working life. In the future it’s possible that 
                robots can have reduced size and weight, this would make them much more human-like. 
                <br><br>
                Notes - <br>
                > An electrolyte is a liquid or gel containing ions that are the result of dissociation. <br>
                > Electrodes are an electric conductor used to contact non-metallic parts of a circuit. <br>
                > Chitosan is a sugar that comes from the outer skeleton of crabs, lobsters, and prawns. <br>
                > An ionic liquid is a salt in the liquid state. 
                <br><br>     
                Elastic Electric Cable - <br>
                Rigid cables can limit movement, become jumbled, and their use has a wear ‘n’ tear limit. These 
                issues can be solved with the use of elastic electric cables, a cable developed by Asahi Kasei 
                Fibers, these cables follow specified shapes so that there is a lot less interference with a 
                robot’s movements. In terms of elasticity, the manufacturer compares them to human skin. 
                <br><br>
                Artificial Skin - <br>
                Laval University created the breakthrough technology of tactile artificial skin and is said to 
                majorly advance human-robot cooperation. Factory robots are powerful, unemotional, and do all 
                the tasks told to them, making them a huge threat to factory workers and so to help with this, 
                tactile artificial skin was investigated. The strength and speed of a robot mixed with the 
                dexterity and analytical ability of a human would increase cooperation. The skin used in 
                prototyping is used to interact with the robots, for example, if you push gently on their 
                artificial skin, they’ll know that contact was made and deduce a command to perform. These 
                prototype robots are made to assist the worker and respond to their requests “as if they were 
                an extension of the body of the worker.”
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>What Is The Likely Impact?</h3>
            <p>
                All this robot talk will worry some about the future; “Will robots take over the world?”, “Will 
                they take over our jobs?” These are good questions and two that sci-fi has attempted to give 
                the worst-case scenarios about for years; however, robots have been all around us for a while. 
                They’ve been automated machines and virtual assistants. So, if they were to “take over” it 
                might not actually be that different, unless you’re fond of entry-level or less cognitive jobs, 
                or they hate us. 
                <br><br>
                It is possible that by 2030, 30% of all jobs would be done by robots, but is that a bad thing? 
                That question is dependent on the type of work said robots would be doing, for example, how 
                many small or entry-level jobs would be left by 2030? Will robots take over the high-level and 
                highly skilled jobs? Would they be able to do every job? Could they rebel? If an Arnold 
                Schwarzenegger bot comes back from the future, you’ll know we’re screwed... that hasn’t happened 
                yet, so we should be fine. Maybe. 
                <br><br>
                To answer the questions above, it has been estimated that 20 million jobs will be replaced with 
                robots by 2030, those jobs include, but are not limited to - <br>
                > Customer service executives <br>
                > Bookkeeping/data entry <br>
                > Receptionists <br>
                > Proof reading <br>
                > Manufacturing <br>
                > Pharmaceuticals <br>
                > Retail <br><br>
                There are some jobs that robots cannot do <i>yet</i>, those include the creative, varied, or “human” 
                jobs that an A.I. cannot replicate - <br>
                > Human resources <br>
                > Public Relations <br>
                > Writers <br>
                > Scientists <br>
                > Psychiatrists <br>
                > Graphic Designers <br>
                > Software Developers<br><br>
                There are jobs that a robotic individual can do, and there are some they cannot, and that’s not 
                even going over if people prefer a more “human” touch. So, answering the question “Will robots 
                take over our jobs?” is difficult to answer, however, based on the above evidence, it’s likely 
                that they will not take over every single job. The smaller, entry-level, or less cognitive is 
                going to include the robotic, but then again, some people do prefer a more “human” aspect from 
                shopping at Big W or trying to find a specific tool at Bunnings. Making this a much trickier 
                question to answer, however, it’s a possibility that there will be some smaller-level jobs 
                remaining. It is also possible that new jobs would be created, either to ensure that the robots 
                work at optimal capacity, or to assist people who do prefer the “human” touch. Could be both. 
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>How Will This Affect You?</h3>
            <p>
                Potentially, robots should be able to take many of the more repetitive jobs, as mentioned 
                above. This would affect me or any of my family members, if by 2030 robots do in fact take 
                over 20 million jobs. This would mean I or anyone else would have to learn more creative ways 
                to earn money part-time or casually, however, this doesn’t affect me as much as it would the 
                people reliant on working in retail, data entry, or even cooking (remember burger bot). 
                <br><br>
                Another factor to consider is how the people reliant on the jobs without a university degree 
                would be able to live, the economy doesn’t exactly take robots taking over jobs into 
                consideration and not everyone is skilled in the more “human-specific,” varied, or creative 
                sections of work. We, however, cannot determine exactly how robots will affect our lives and 
                the workforce. 
                <br><br>
                Programming an artificial intelligence with the body and capabilities of a human would be an 
                incredible advancement, it could even lead to new and exciting discoveries about humans, the 
                world around us, and even the universe. This does not answer how robots affect me, however.  
                <br><br>
                If I had a home assistant bot, I wouldn’t have to get up every time I wanted to turn the lights 
                off, I could get a sandwich made for me instead of making one myself, or I’d slowly start making 
                the robot do all the mundane household tasks. Wouldn’t that be nice. With all the free time I'd 
                have, there would be more shows to binge, more movies to watch, and more games to start losing 
                interest in. To put it simply, my life would be easier but dull. Either way, I find the rise of 
                robotics very interesting, so any new development would be exciting to hear about.  
                <br><br>
                In my daily life, there would be quite a lot of changes. For example, I wouldn’t have to serve 
                in any potential wars, “no experience required” jobs would be far harder to get, I could hire 
                burger bot, or, on a much more serious note, there will be a lot less things to do in life. I 
                prefer the feeling of doing things for myself, from baking myself a cake to writing a program, 
                all with as little external help as possible, that’s just who I am. The rise of robotics is 
                likely to create a world where the smaller things in life, the stuff many can count as a waste 
                of time, the acts that I enjoy doing as the feeling of doing it myself, could become obsolete 
                activities and that would make things rather dull. 
                <br><br>
                An existence where I’d get served instead of doing thing myself is one to shudder at, but that 
                does not mean there will be no improvements to my or anyone else’s life. Robots could make 
                interesting co-op players in video games, they could be used as friends for the lonely, 
                dangerous jobs will not have to be done by people, challenge lovers of quite literally anything
                would have their greatest matches against well-developed robots, and mathematicians, scientists, 
                and researchers could all use the robotic to help with their work, to experiment on, to see how 
                far they’ve come, and to better their work. 
                <br><br>
                Robotics is a field that can be described as a coin flip, there is a 50/50 chance that they are 
                an amazing creation, or a plague unleashed upon us, by us. We don’t know what the future will 
                hold and where robots fit into that future, but we do know that our lives will change, of that 
                there is no doubt.

            <h2>Autonomous Driving -</h2>
            <!-- Copy & paste your technology details from the A2 document here -->
        <h3>What Does it do?</h3>

            In the simplest terms, autonomous driving is the ability of a car or any form of machine to 
            navigate itself from a start point to a predetermined destination without user or driver 
            intervention or assistance. There are multiple real-world examples today of semi-autonomous 
            driving; this is defined by the car's ability to perform a basic level of driving function 
            without intervention by the user. Some examples of these technologies include autonomous brake
            assistance, where the vehicle will use sensor data to brake the car when it has predicted a 
            collision is imamate. Or active lane-keeping, where sensors will collect data from the road and 
            actively assist the driver keep the car's position between the road lines.  
            <br><br>
            While these technologies and more do not constitute autonomous driving, they are becoming commonplace 
            in most new cars. They indicate the first step towards full autonomous vehicle on the road. Many 
            companies have implemented features that will intervene in a safety crisis and take control of the 
            vehicle. Still, it is essential to mention that there are significant barriers to the full automation 
            of vehicles that most car companies have yet to encounter.  
            <br><br>
            It would be hard to talk about autonomous driving technologies without mentioning Tesla. Where most 
            companies have focused on driver assistance rather than automation, Tesla has moved quickly into the 
            space of autonomous driving, having released multiple versions of their autonomous driving software, 
            Autopilot. As it stands today, autopilot has not reached a level where it could be considered entirely 
            autonomous and still requires a driver to be conscious and have a hand on the wheel when autopilot is 
            operating, primarily due to regulation and the fact that this software is still considered a beta or in 
            development. From all available examples of current technologies, we can create an image that should 
            closely approximate what an autonomous vehicle of the future will look like, both the hardware and 
            software. 
            <br><br>
            Starting with the hardware, autonomous vehicles will require an extensive array of sensors, including 
            radar, Lidar and cameras, among others. The primary use of these sensors is to provide the car with eyes, 
            allowing it to perceive its surroundings. Today, some, if not most, cars are fitted with a reverse camera 
            that provides a great example of how these sensors would operate. The main difference is the interpretation 
            of the data assessed by a computer rather than a human operator. This brings us to the computer hardware, which 
            is not new to cars as most have been fitted with some form of computer for many years. Still, nothing is close 
            to processing the billions of calculations per second required for total autonomous driving. The more sensors 
            attached to the car, the more necessary the computer is to process and interpret all the data collected by the 
            connected sensors. The requirements assumed for processing the amount of data that the sensors will be taking 
            in and proving response in the form of velocity adjustment have already changed in the last decade compared 
            to what was first conceptualised. As the first responder, Tesla suggested that their earliest cars would be 
            capable of full self-driving. But after updating their in-car computers to custom-designed silicon in 2018, 
            they adjusted expectations for the ability of the earlier models to be capable of full self-driving. The new 
            chips provided a remarkable increase in processing power from the older models said to be needed to implement 
            full self-driving properly.

            What makes a good driver? The best car will only be as good as the driver behind the wheel. Still, when it comes 
            to autonomous driving, we are not talking about any physical entity behind the wheel but a software program 
            interpreting sensor data and making decisions based on the data. Multiple companies are collecting data to teach 
            these programs how to drive. This data can come in many forms, including real drivers and maps. There have already 
            been multiple examples of retrofitted autonomous cars having minor accidents on roads; these cars are training 
            and collecting various data points for companies to research. Tesla has openly admitted to using acquiring driver 
            data from their customers to help prepare their autopilot software.  
            <br><br>
            While autonomous driving, as outlined above, is focused on the consumer car market, in its very essence, a machine 
            can be able to control itself between two points while being able to adjust and overcome any number of issues that 
            could arise during the journey as any physical driver would. This technology could be applied to any machine that a 
            person usually operates. 
            <br><br>
            <h3>What is the likely Impact?</h3>
            The impact of autonomous driving could be similar to the mobile computing revolution when you consider the total 
            effect on our day to day lives. So much of our modern world requires transport; it is how we commute, receive and send. 
            Imagine if you could apply the same increase in productivity that email has had over your regular postal service to 
            every aspect of transport. 
            <br><br>
            A fully functioning autonomous driver would be able to pilot a vehicle at higher speeds than any human operator 
            while maintaining safety standards beyond that same human's ability. The increase in speed alone would revolutionise 
            a consumer-driven world that is speed focused. To use a minor example, most people will have utilised a click and collect 
            feature from a supermarket to do a grocery shop or even delivery at one point during the recent pandemic. Still, we 
            see supermarket employees walking the isles collecting goods for customers; with autonomous driving technologies, most 
            touchpoints for this basic process could be automated and robotised. An autonomous vehicle could walk the isles and 
            collect the goods before dispensing them at the drop off point for delivery. The next autonomous vehicle receives the 
            goods and drops them off to the consumer, with the entire process taking potentially less than 60min from order to 
            delivery. 
            <br><br>
            While this example illustrates a likely positive outcome of autonomous driving technologies, it is also essential to 
            consider some downsides. Employment within the transportation industry is a notable example of a potential negative 
            impact of this emerging technology. Replacing drivers as a general term could lead to a mass of unemployed, relatively 
            low skilled workers. While some could potentially be retrained to continue the development of autonomous vehicles, 
            most would be left without a source of income. Broadly the field of automation has many worried about this outcome. 
            As income inequality already runs rampant in our economy, these technologies serve only to continue to grow the 
            wealth of the smallest number of individuals, who continue to devalue this sort of work and the employees who do it.  
            <br><br>
            The overall impact on the world as we know it will be immense; for better or worse, we will have to wait and see. 
            Without any doubt, technologies like autonomous driving have the potential to impact the world for the better, 
            improving the greater good. Still, as with most giant leaps forward in technology, it will be equally essential to 
            drive the change responsibly. 
            <br><br>
            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
            As seen through a personal lens, autonomous driving will be different for every individual, but my day-to-day life 
            will change immensely for myself, like many others. I travel in one form or another every day. I often drive myself 
            or someone else to work or a meeting; this takes hours every day. This alone will leave me with potentially 8-16 hours 
            every week that would otherwise be occupied with driving for other activities.  
            <br><br>
            This is no small amount of time to be gifted with; the question becomes, what do you do with your newfound wealth of 
            spare hours. Assuming that at the same time, most of the world's transport has become automated in one way or another, 
            the time savings within personal vehicles are only beginning. Still, as we accumulate more spare time, leading towards 
            a world of leisure and pleasure in the best-case scenario, we should also consider how most time-saving technologies 
            implemented over the last few decades have impacted our lives.  
            <br><br>
            Most technologies designed to save human time have had their fruits consumed by capitalism. While productivity has 
            increased, free time has decreased as corporations milk us for each spare minute of our time through work and play. 
            Will we be required to work through our commute in this new autonomous world? Every day, two extra hours sounds 
            like a tempting treat for any company with an employee who thought they might read a book or play a game while 
            their car drove them to work.  
            <br><br>
            As a car owner, selecting a vehicle based on individual needs and wants provides an exciting point about purchasing 
            an autonomous vehicle. Would one even need to own such a vehicle? While today so much of a car purchase is based on 
            the driver, what would this same purchase look like if you would never drive it? You would be buying a comfortable 
            chair. This assumes that we, or more correctly, car companies, have not found a new way to differentiate themselves 
            in the market, such as their autonomous driving software quality. 
            <br><br>
            Autonomous driving will impact our lives in many fundamental ways, such as changing the need for milestones such as 
            getting a driver's licence and many more intriguing ways that cannot be perceived yet. Like most changes of this magnitude, 
            we will be responsible for its impact on us. The hope is that we learn to utilise the tools we create to further the human 
            condition for the better rather than allowing ourselves to become slaves to the machines that were meant to improve our lives.
