            <h2>Robots -</h2>
            <!-- Copy & paste your technology details from the A2 document here -->
            <h3>What Does It Do?</h3>
            <p>
                The Oxford dictionary gives two definitions to robots -
                <br>
                1 - A machine that is made to look like a human and that can do some things that a human 
                can do
                <br>
                2 - A machine that can perform a complicated series of tasks automatically 
                <br><br>
                In the past neither of those were possibilities, but that didn’t stop Hollywood from making 
                the Terminator. Today the field of robotics is in almost every aspect of our lives, and it’s 
                evolving at a rapid pace. In fact, a robot has been created that looks somewhat like a human, 
                this robot, Ameca, is in the process of learning human-like facial expressions. Each of Ameca’s 
                modules/parts run independently, so just the head, or arm would work without any major issues. 
                At this point in time, Ameca can detect people, track their faces, detect objects and react to 
                them. Ameca can even move in a human-like manner. 
                <br><br>
                Other than Ameca, some robots are being used or developed to do jobs that could be considered 
                dirty, boring, or dangerous. Those kinds of jobs include - <br>
                > Manufacturing <br>
                > Assembly <br>
                > Packing <br>
                > Transport <br>
                > Earth / Space Exploration <br> 
                > Surgery <br>
                > Weaponry <br>
                > Lab Research <br>
                > Burger Creation <br>
                Yes, a robot was made to create burgers. Some are even being used as emotional support for 
                the lonely.
                <br><br>
                A few robotic projects of the past include - 
                <br><br>
                2011 Burger Bot - <br>
                A robot that can create a burger in less than 10 seconds, developed by Momentum Machines. 
                It can "slice toppings like tomatoes and pickles immediately before it places the slice 
                onto your burger, giving you the freshest burger possible." It was created as a garage project 
                and gained years of excitement. 
                <br><br>
                Google’s worker robots - <br>
                Google won a patent on March 31st, 2015, to create worker robots with personalities. The 
                personalities are downloadable from the cloud. One robot can download and use many personalities 
                so that it can interact with many different types of people. 
                <br><br>
                UR3 Arm - <br>
                On March 23rd, 2015, Universal Robots, a Denmark-based robotics company revealed the UR3, a 
                robot designed to handle repetitive manual tasks that weigh up to 3kg. It can replace its own 
                parts and can glue, paint, solder, and weld. 
                <br><br>
                Saul Robot - <br>
                In 2014, Xenex created a robot capable of handling the deadly disease Ebola. It does so with 
                powerful pulses of highly electrical ultraviolet rays, these rays weaken the cells of the Ebola 
                virus. This bot was named Saul Robot. 
                <br><br>
                Asus Zenbo - <br>
                This robot was created on March 21st, 2016, and is essentially your tiny, friendly home 
                assistant. It can autonomously roll around, as well as understand your verbal commands to 
                enable it to do tasks. An Asus Zenbo can be used to remember daily tasks, monitor surroundings 
                to detect emergencies, and it can access smart home services. 
                <br><br>
                Some robotic parts currently in the development segment of creation includes the artificial 
                muscles, artificial skin, and the elastic electric cable. 
                <br><br>
                Artificial Muscles - <br>
                The artificial muscles are created with Carbon Nanotubes. These nanotubes are created with 
                double electrode layers that are separated by a chitosan electrolyte layer consisting of an 
                ionic liquid. The response time is 19 milliseconds, thousands of available frequency ranges, 
                large stress generation of a rate of 1080 Megapascals per second, and high mechanical output 
                power density of 244 Watts per kilogram. This means that the artificial muscles have low power 
                consumption, high flexibility, and a very long working life. In the future it’s possible that 
                robots can have reduced size and weight, this would make them much more human-like. 
                <br><br>
                Notes - <br>
                > An electrolyte is a liquid or gel containing ions that are the result of dissociation. <br>
                > Electrodes are an electric conductor used to contact non-metallic parts of a circuit. <br>
                > Chitosan is a sugar that comes from the outer skeleton of crabs, lobsters, and prawns. <br>
                > An ionic liquid is a salt in the liquid state. 
                <br><br>     
                Elastic Electric Cable - <br>
                Rigid cables can limit movement, become jumbled, and their use has a wear ‘n’ tear limit. These 
                issues can be solved with the use of elastic electric cables, a cable developed by Asahi Kasei 
                Fibers, these cables follow specified shapes so that there is a lot less interference with a 
                robot’s movements. In terms of elasticity, the manufacturer compares them to human skin. 
                <br><br>
                Artificial Skin - <br>
                Laval University created the breakthrough technology of tactile artificial skin and is said to 
                majorly advance human-robot cooperation. Factory robots are powerful, unemotional, and do all 
                the tasks told to them, making them a huge threat to factory workers and so to help with this, 
                tactile artificial skin was investigated. The strength and speed of a robot mixed with the 
                dexterity and analytical ability of a human would increase cooperation. The skin used in 
                prototyping is used to interact with the robots, for example, if you push gently on their 
                artificial skin, they’ll know that contact was made and deduce a command to perform. These 
                prototype robots are made to assist the worker and respond to their requests “as if they were 
                an extension of the body of the worker.”
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>What Is The Likely Impact?</h3>
            <p>
                All this robot talk will worry some about the future; “Will robots take over the world?”, “Will 
                they take over our jobs?” These are good questions and two that sci-fi has attempted to give 
                the worst-case scenarios about for years; however, robots have been all around us for a while. 
                They’ve been automated machines and virtual assistants. So, if they were to “take over” it 
                might not actually be that different, unless you’re fond of entry-level or less cognitive jobs, 
                or they hate us. 
                <br><br>
                It is possible that by 2030, 30% of all jobs would be done by robots, but is that a bad thing? 
                That question is dependent on the type of work said robots would be doing, for example, how 
                many small or entry-level jobs would be left by 2030? Will robots take over the high-level and 
                highly skilled jobs? Would they be able to do every job? Could they rebel? If an Arnold 
                Schwarzenegger bot comes back from the future, you’ll know we’re screwed... that hasn’t happened 
                yet, so we should be fine. Maybe. 
                <br><br>
                To answer the questions above, it has been estimated that 20 million jobs will be replaced with 
                robots by 2030, those jobs include, but are not limited to - <br>
                > Customer service executives <br>
                > Bookkeeping/data entry <br>
                > Receptionists <br>
                > Proof reading <br>
                > Manufacturing <br>
                > Pharmaceuticals <br>
                > Retail <br><br>
                There are some jobs that robots cannot do <i>yet</i>, those include the creative, varied, or “human” 
                jobs that an A.I. cannot replicate - <br>
                > Human resources <br>
                > Public Relations <br>
                > Writers <br>
                > Scientists <br>
                > Psychiatrists <br>
                > Graphic Designers <br>
                > Software Developers<br><br>
                There are jobs that a robotic individual can do, and there are some they cannot, and that’s not 
                even going over if people prefer a more “human” touch. So, answering the question “Will robots 
                take over our jobs?” is difficult to answer, however, based on the above evidence, it’s likely 
                that they will not take over every single job. The smaller, entry-level, or less cognitive is 
                going to include the robotic, but then again, some people do prefer a more “human” aspect from 
                shopping at Big W or trying to find a specific tool at Bunnings. Making this a much trickier 
                question to answer, however, it’s a possibility that there will be some smaller-level jobs 
                remaining. It is also possible that new jobs would be created, either to ensure that the robots 
                work at optimal capacity, or to assist people who do prefer the “human” touch. Could be both. 
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>How Will This Affect You?</h3>
            <p>
                Potentially, robots should be able to take many of the more repetitive jobs, as mentioned 
                above. This would affect me or any of my family members, if by 2030 robots do in fact take 
                over 20 million jobs. This would mean I or anyone else would have to learn more creative ways 
                to earn money part-time or casually, however, this doesn’t affect me as much as it would the 
                people reliant on working in retail, data entry, or even cooking (remember burger bot). 
                <br><br>
                Another factor to consider is how the people reliant on the jobs without a university degree 
                would be able to live, the economy doesn’t exactly take robots taking over jobs into 
                consideration and not everyone is skilled in the more “human-specific,” varied, or creative 
                sections of work. We, however, cannot determine exactly how robots will affect our lives and 
                the workforce. 
                <br><br>
                Programming an artificial intelligence with the body and capabilities of a human would be an 
                incredible advancement, it could even lead to new and exciting discoveries about humans, the 
                world around us, and even the universe. This does not answer how robots affect me, however.  
                <br><br>
                If I had a home assistant bot, I wouldn’t have to get up every time I wanted to turn the lights 
                off, I could get a sandwich made for me instead of making one myself, or I’d slowly start making 
                the robot do all the mundane household tasks. Wouldn’t that be nice. With all the free time I'd 
                have, there would be more shows to binge, more movies to watch, and more games to start losing 
                interest in. To put it simply, my life would be easier but dull. Either way, I find the rise of 
                robotics very interesting, so any new development would be exciting to hear about.  
                <br><br>
                In my daily life, there would be quite a lot of changes. For example, I wouldn’t have to serve 
                in any potential wars, “no experience required” jobs would be far harder to get, I could hire 
                burger bot, or, on a much more serious note, there will be a lot less things to do in life. I 
                prefer the feeling of doing things for myself, from baking myself a cake to writing a program, 
                all with as little external help as possible, that’s just who I am. The rise of robotics is 
                likely to create a world where the smaller things in life, the stuff many can count as a waste 
                of time, the acts that I enjoy doing as the feeling of doing it myself, could become obsolete 
                activities and that would make things rather dull. 
                <br><br>
                An existence where I’d get served instead of doing thing myself is one to shudder at, but that 
                does not mean there will be no improvements to my or anyone else’s life. Robots could make 
                interesting co-op players in video games, they could be used as friends for the lonely, 
                dangerous jobs will not have to be done by people, challenge lovers of quite literally anything
                would have their greatest matches against well-developed robots, and mathematicians, scientists, 
                and researchers could all use the robotic to help with their work, to experiment on, to see how 
                far they’ve come, and to better their work. 
                <br><br>
                Robotics is a field that can be described as a coin flip, there is a 50/50 chance that they are 
                an amazing creation, or a plague unleashed upon us, by us. We don’t know what the future will 
                hold and where robots fit into that future, but we do know that our lives will change, of that 
                there is no doubt.
